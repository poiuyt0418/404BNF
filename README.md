-Walkthrough-

1ST LEVEL
Start the level, leave the room you’re currently in. Take a left and approach the room located there. Click on the box on the wall. Complete the wire puzzle, and link the appropriate colors.
Approach the magnet hand, complete the quick time event by clicking the popups on screen with the mouse.
If successful, you’ve now installed that part. Leave, and approach the checkerboard near the right side of the room. Complete the chess puzzle, by dropping the chess piece on the green part of the board. After, head down into the now open room, approach the hand and repeat the prior QTE steps. Leave, and go down the hall to the robot body at the end.

You’ve now completed Level 1. Note that there is a white arrow directing you to the next objective.

2ND LEVEL
Start the level, leave the room. Follow the arrow to the upper right hand part of the room. Approach the door, click on the wirebox, and complete the puzzle. 
Approach the second magnet hand and complete the QTE once more before the popups disappear. Once you’ve got the hand, leave the room to the bottom left corner, near another checkerboard. 
The key here is that all the pieces must land on a green tile in one turn. Blue makes the piece move forward one tile.
Place the black piece on the blue tile, and place the other three white pieces on the other blue tile, and green tiles respectively. 
The door on the left of the board should open. Enter the room and obtain your new part.
Leave the room, and go to the bottom left corner. Complete the wire puzzle, enter the room, and complete the QTE once more. 
Leave the room, and go to the top of the next room. Enter the door.

You’ve completed Level 2.
